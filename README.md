# Cue ⏯️

**Cue** is a modern, cross-platform media launcher that remembers exactly where you left off. It acts as a smart dashboard for your local media, tracking playback progress for both individual files and folder-based playlists.

## ✨ Features

* **Universal Resume:** Remembers playback position for any video or audio file.
* **Cross-Platform:** Works natively on **Windows** (mpv) and **Linux** (Celluloid or mpv).
* **Folder Support:** Intelligently resumes entire folders (series/playlists) from the exact file you stopped at.
* **Visual History:** See progress bars, duration, and "Finished" status for your media library.
* **Driver System:** Configurable backend to support both CLI players (STDOUT) and GUI wrappers (IPC Sockets).
